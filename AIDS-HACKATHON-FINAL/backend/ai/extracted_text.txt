Abstract
The sixth generation (6G) wireless technology is designed for advanced applications such as immersive reality, autono-
mous vehicle communication, and holographic communication. Central to 6G systems are RF transceivers, including 
amplifiers, mixers, and antennas. For 6G to support higher data rates and ensure network reliability in higher frequency 
bands, antennas need to be simple in design, cost-effective for mass production, and have better radiation performance 
than 5G antennas. This paper provides a brief review of recent advancements in 6G antenna design, covering deploy-
ment scenarios, design methodologies, and radiation characteristics, aiming to enhance readers’ understanding of 6G 
antenna architectures.
Keywords  6G wireless technology · Antenna applications · MIMO antenna · Extended virtual reality
1  Introduction
Early in the 2030s is when sixth generation (6G) wireless technology is anticipated to become a reality. [1, 2].To 
make this technology a reality, engineers, governments, international bodies are actively investing in research to 
make this promise a reality. Although the 6G technology is built on the foundation of fifth generation (5G) and 5G 
advanced, 6G technology is expected to provide a higher spectral efficiency, very low latency, optimal AI (Artificial 
Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) connectivity, and higher data coverage than 5G. Some notable applications 
include extended virtual reality (XR), digital twins, and holographic communications. Essentially, it is anticipated that 
6G technology would close the gap between the digital and real worlds. To support these applications, you need 
enabling technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), AI, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), ultra 
massive MIMO and more. The main challenge for WPT is the sharp decline in energy transfer efficiency with distance 
due to considerable route loss. Researchers have examined MIMO systems, especially massive MIMO, and energy 
beamforming algorithms for their ability to direct highly directed RF signal power onto user equipment (UEs) in order 
to address this problem [3–6]. Fading may have a substantial influence on wearable device-to-wearer communication 
in practical wireless propagation circumstances, especially where wireless communication is essential for military 
operations team coordination, mission control, and situational awareness [7]. It is now simple and quick to design 
microstrip filters using a Transmission Line model (TL) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). To demonstrate the effective-
ness of the recommended approach, a wideband second-order bandpass filter with a center frequency of 2.3 GHz

is tested using two short-circuited and two open-circuited stubs [8]. In recent years, off-chip DRA designs, such as 
small and in-substrate DRAs, have become more and more popular. The reason behind this increase in demand is 
the swift advancement of economical methods for producing multilayer laminates, like Low-Temperature Co-fired 
Ceramic (LTCC) and Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) [9]. Regardless of the application 6G supports, RF (Radio Frequency) 
transceivers are inevitable part of a 6G architecture. A generic RF MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) transceiver 
is shown in the Fig. 1. This generic RF MIMO transceiver architecture included a phase shifter at its transmitter and 
its receiver. This is because to accurately capture the transmitted signal, phase shifts are necessary to align the array 
beam with the direction from which the received signal arrives [10]. It should be noted that the input to the RF 
transmitter and the output from the RF receiver are not depicted in Fig. 1, as the main emphasis of this review paper 
is on antenna designs rather than RF transceiver architectures.
This paper focusses on a review of the around 50 most promising 6G antenna architectures, a key component 
of RF transceivers. This paper also highlights the key characteristics of these antenna architectures and how it can 
be a considered a promising candidate for 6G applications. The 6G antenna architectures are sorted based on their 
operating frequencies: mid- and high-frequency band antennas. Mid-frequency band 6G antennas operate between 
1–100 GHz and high-frequency band 6G antennas operate above 100 GHz. This paper also provides antenna overview 
tables that highlights key characteristics of the antennas that are discussed in this review paper. The antennas are 
reviewed or succinctly summarized based on increasing order of resonant frequencies.
The remainder of the work is structured in this manner. In each of the sections 2 and 3, which provide a brief 
summary of the features and performance of each design, a brief discussion of the relative benefits and drawbacks 
of each antenna type as well as comparisons with the results of current technologies would give readers a more 
nuanced understanding of their practical implications. Section 2 summarizes the key characteristics of mid-frequency 
6G antennas, while Section 3 summarizes the key characteristics of high-frequency 6G antennas as documented in 
recent publications. The developed results in this review work can be studied in a number of ways; these are briefly 
described in Section 4 as potential future directions. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.
Table 1 in section 2 and Table 2 in section 3 offers a comprehensive overview of the essential features of mid-
frequency and high frequency 6G antennas as outlined in recent scholarly publications respectively. Specifically, it 
presents a concise summary of 50 diverse antenna designs, detailing their operating frequencies and highlighting key 
characteristics. The tables also include important specifications such as bandwidth, gain, aperture efficiency, and ­S11, 
which are critical for evaluating antenna performance. Table 3 in section 3 summarizes the fabrication technology, 
advantages, disadvantages, applications, and challenges of a few previous works. Table 4 in section 4 summarizes the 
various implementation methods and technologies for a few contemporary 6G wireless communication networks. By 
compiling this information in a single, easy-to-navigate format, Table 1, 2, 3 & 4 serves as a valuable quick reference 
for researchers. It enables them to efficiently compare and contrast the fundamental aspects of different antenna 
designs, facilitating informed decision-making in the exploration and development of 6G antenna technologies. This 
structured presentation of data not only saves time but also helps in identifying the most suitable antenna configura-
tions for specific applications or research needs.

2  Mid‑frequency 6G antenna architectures
Table 1. Presents a summary of the key characteristics of mid-frequency 6G antennas as documented in recent 
publications.
2.1  8‑Port MIMO antenna module
The antenna discussed in [11] operates within the 6 GHz frequency bands, and it has been shown that using MIMO with 
eight spatial streams, it can attain a spectral efficiency exceeding 56 bps/Hz. Figure 2 shows the geometry of the 1 × 2 
module array with two eight-port multiple-input and multiple-output (8PM) antenna modules mounted on a ground 
plane. (a) Top (b) side view (c) Back view. This antenna is an 8PM antenna module designed to provide eight uncorrelated 
waves operating in the 6.425–7.125 GHz range using four patch antennas. These patch antennas feature dual polariza-
tion, and the entire module is designed to be compact, with each antenna element taking up just 0.074λ2 of area. The 
antenna has been extended to a 1-by-2 8PM configuration and tested to provide up to 10 Gbps data throughput with 
200 MHz bandwidth, thereby enabling a spectral efficiency (ηs) exceeding 56 bps/Hz. This achieved ηs is thrice than that 
of a 4-by-4 MIMO for 5G operation at 3.5 GHz. The ports 1–8 of the 8PM antennas are excited to generate eight uncorre-
lated waves at the desired frequency bands. Port isolation is achieved by adding a shorted disk in the four dual-polarized 
antennas, which slightly diverts the surface currents. This antenna has been applied to a 16-by-8 MIMO test bed system 
and measured for its bit error rate, throughput, spectral efficiency, and Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR). The results obtained 
from these measurements are summarized in [11].
2.2  4‑port MIMO antenna module
6G devices are anticipated to support more MIMO spatial streams than their 5G counterparts. As a result, this antenna 
is targeted to operate in 7.025–8.4 GHz to achieve larger spectral efficiency. Figure 3 shows geometry of the low-profile 
four-port MIMO (4PM) antenna module. (a) Top and side views. (b) Perspective view. The antenna [12] is constructed 
using 4PM antenna modules that forms 16-port closely spaced 2-by-2 module array. Since 16-port structures occupies 
large device real estate, using 4-port MIMO antenna modules makes the antenna low profile to support eight spatial 
streams with the ηs of 56 bps/Hz. Simulation of this structure reveals that the antenna resonates at approximately 7.3 
and 8.3 GHz with a 3:1 VSWR, a common standard for mobile antennas. These results are attributed to the antenna struc-
ture: four square top sub patches with truncated inner corners are printed on a FR4 substrate, separated by a layer of air.

2.3  Planar lens antenna for X‑band 6G applications
High-gain antennas are in demand when it comes to compensate free space path loss in higher operating frequen-
cies. This is applicable in sensing and massive MIMO systems [13, 14]. Massive MIMO systems can employ EM lens 
with large antenna array to tap into benefits of energy focussing and spatial interference rejection [15, 16]. The Lens 
antenna array focus signals into distinct paths i.e. focus energy based on Angle of Arrival (AoA) of signals reducing 
the need for multiple RF chains [17, 18].
The contour map of the power of the signals received by various lens array elements for signals coming at (θ, φ) 
= (0,0) and (0, –15°), respectively, is displayed in Figure 4. The experimental verification confirms that the energy 
focusing antennas of lens arrays fluctuate with the orientations of the signals when a signal arrives at a different 
direction (θ, φ) = (0, –15°). These antennas are relocated to those with indices around (3, 4).
In [19], a novel design is suggested to enhance antenna gain through a single-layer metasurface comprising several 
circular metal patches combined with rectangular slots. These slots determine polarization of antenna. This paper also 
compares non-resonant and resonant planar lens antenna designs. The non-resonant planar lens antennas require 
high permittivity materials which makes fabrication unfeasible. But using metasurfaces, one can design a high gain 
planar antennas without high permittivity materials. The shape of the planar lens is optimized to achieve an increased 
gain for a single patch antenna, which rises from 7.2 dBi to 16 dBi at 10 GHz and reaches 12.8 dBi at 10.4 GHz within 
the X-band spectrum. This eliminates the necessity for an array feeding network, thereby reducing losses generated 
by feed. These factors contributed to high gain planar structures.
2.4  Glass shaped patch antenna for UWB and 6G applications
To provide reliable 6G networks in urban areas, higher data capacity is required, and the frequency of interest that 
can achieve this desired outcome is centimetric waves. The centimetric wave bands are also referred as mid-band 6G 
spectrum that pans from 7–20 GHz will be one of the promising frequency bands that can provide a robust coverage 
in urban areas. The ideal antenna candidate to meet these requirements are patch antennas because they are easy

for impedance matching purposes. The ground plane is also etched with a semi-circular is etched to further enhance 
the impedance bandwidth. This configuration provides an UWB antenna that operates between 2.69–20.05 GHz with 
a fractional bandwidth of 152.68% and a VSWR < 2 for the entire operating frequency band.

2.5  Slotted stacked patch antenna array for 6G satellite mobile communication systems
Another antenna candidate discussed in [21] is used to increase the data capacity is active antenna array. The frequency 
of interest that was chosen is in K/Ka band and this antenna array is targeted to provide beam steering patterns for 6G TX/
RX satellite mobile communication systems. Figure 6 shows the 3D view of the square-ring patch 8 × 8 sub-antenna. The 
first step in designing this antenna is to calculate the link budget of a satellite link and determine its gain. The antenna 
gain has been found to be a minimum of 35 dB. The next step in the active antenna design process is choosing an ideal 
candidate for antenna element that meet the requirements. The filtering antennas or filtennas are chosen because they 
do not require additional filtering systems. For an element in the antenna array, a patch antenna that resembles like a 
stacked square-ring is selected for its filtering capability, simple design, and low cost. The stacked square antenna con-
sists of two square rings that are stacked on each other to increase the operating bandwidth and decrease the ­Zin. The 
radiation pattern is notably wide, exhibiting a peak directivity perpendicular to the antenna’s plane and null directions 
parallel to the ground plane. This element is extended to an 8-by-8 array comprising of 64 elements and this array reso-
nates at 19.5 GHz and 29.5 GHz with the directivity of 23.3 dBi at 30° scanning. The paper discusses that if 8-by-8 array is 
extended to 64-by-64 antenna array, then the directivity and gain can be improved.
2.6  Sandwiched PRS Fabry–Perot antenna
Since 6G RF architecture demands a compact PCB real estate, the choice Fabry–Perot (FP) antennas come to mind. FP 
antennas are favored in wireless communications for their high gain characteristics, though this high gain comes at a 
cost of larger cavity height. Figure 7 shows the (a) Side view of the FP antenna, (b) geometry of the slit radiator. The FP 
antenna architecture incudes a substrate, Partially Reflective Surfaces (PRS), and one or more superstrates.The distance 
between substrate and superstrate, cavity height, is expected to be λ/2 for optimal Aperture Efficiency (AE). But with 
demand of compact RF architecture, the antenna in [22] proposes a novel idea in reducing the cavity height up to λ/17 
without compromising AE. The lower cavity height is achieved by sandwiching PRS between two superstrates. This aided 
in reducing the cavity height. The prototype antenna resonates at 25.3 GHz with AE of 79.4% and a gain of 12.35 dBi. Due 
to these simulated results, it makes a promising 6G antenna candidate.
2.7  Wearable ring metal‑dielectric and DR antennas
The demand of light-weight antennas in 6G communications motivated to design antennas that are light-weight and 
economical to fabricate. Figure 8 shows the Patch antenna integrated into a wearable ring (a) top view, (b) side view .To 
do this, the paper [23] introduces Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) to fabricate antennas. FFF uses an in-house machine 
to fabricate metal-dielectric antennas thus 3-D printing of metal and the substrate layer. This paper uses FFF to fabricate 
patch antenna that can be integrated to a wearable ring and a Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA). The advantages of 
using this fabrication methodology are to keep the fabrication cost down. The fabricated patch antenna was measured 
in free space using a hand phantom. This antenna resonated around 28 GHz with 0.6 GHz of impedance bandwidth. This

paper also discusses about fabrication of DRA to emphasis the future scope of fabricating future 6G antennas. The DRA 
resonates at 13.5 GHz and 0.5 GHz impedance bandwidth with the radiation gain above 6 GHz.
2.8  Wideband Antenna‑in‑Package
The Antenna-in-Package (AiP) is commonly used in 60 GHz and above applications. The AiP are cost effective and make 
the antennas compact. This also means that antenna and RF systems share very small physical distance in PCBs, and 
this produces EM interference. The EM interference is introduced by common mode currents and common mode sup-
pression techniques in PCBs are very hard to achieve due to small coupling distance, high permittivity of the material, 
etc., To overcome the challenges, a low-cost antenna AiP antenna is designed in [24] with wideband common-mode 
chocking characteristics. Figure 9 shows the evolution of the proposed antenna. (a) Wideband, High-Efficiency Electro-
magnetic Structure (WHEMS) with a back plate and metal backing cavity. (b) Ideal model of the proposed antenna. (c)

Within this cavity, an enhanced quarter wave transformer, known as a radiating choke, is embedded. This choke effectively

suppresses both common-mode and radiation currents. The structure demonstrates a 22% impedance bandwidth rang-
ing from 60-75 GHz, with a gain of 8–10 dBi.
2.9  mm‑wave conical‑beam antenna
Another compact antenna is discussed in [25] which is targeted for mm-wave low-earth orbit (LEO) systems. Figure 10 
shows the Proposed ME CB antenna.This antenna is a conical-beam (CB) antenna that operates in E-band (71–86 GHz). 
Compared to the existing CB antennas this antenna has a high gain of 12.05 dBi at 76 GHz and wideband planar antenna 
with an impedance bandwidth of 40.9% (59.38–89.95 GHz). The high-gain and wideband characteristics of this antenna 
is achieved by the probe excitation of electric and magnetic dipoles. The realization of these electric dipoles takes the 
shape of two annular rings divided into eight annular sectors. And the magnetic dipoles are realized by five vias that 
are drilled into each annular sector. But this single layer structure has a constraint on the feeding design and imposed 
a limit on the number of elements. This resulted in poor conical radiation. To generate a good conical radiation a multi-
stage circular-cavity substrate integrated waveguide structure is designed and that helped to control the ­TM010/TM020 
resonant modes.
2.10  Tooth‑shaped antenna
The 76–81 GHz frequency band is used for Autonomous Vehicle Applications (AVA) and the RADAR (Radio Detection 
and Ranging) systems that are designed to aid the AVA applications to understand the surrounding environments. To do 
this, these applications require high gain antennas with a broad field view and a narrow beam in azimuth and elevation 
direction. Figure 11 shows the Tooth-shaped patch antenna. The paper [26] compares a conventional insert-fed patch 
antenna and how its performance can be improved by using eight equally spaced tooth-shaped slots and two slots at 
the lower edge of the antenna. Because of its true input admittance, the tooth-shaped antenna design makes it ideal for 
use in both Long-Range Radar (LRR) and Short-Range Radar (SRR) applications. It resonates at 77 GHz, offering a gain

at − 37.9441 dB.
3  High‑frequency band 6G antennas
Table 2 presents a summary of the key characteristics of high frequency 6G antennas as documented in recent 
publications.
3.1  110 GHz antenna array module using AiP
Sub-Terahertz (Sub-THz) frequencies are one of the promising frequency bands in 6G communications. This is primary 
because we can optimize our systems for high data rate. Due to the small wavelength in Sub-THz frequencies, AiPs are 
best suited to realize antenna array module. In this paper [27], a 110 GHz antenna array module was realized in AiP. At 
Sub-THz, AiP radiation performance will vary because most System-in-Package (SiP) fabrication processes have been 
designed for packaging low frequency RF systems. Conventional SIP architectures employs even substrates in total: A 
core substrate with thicker thickness for mechanical support and this core substrate is stacked with three thinner sub-
strates top and bottom of the core substrate with prepreg materials. Figure 12 shows the Stacked dielectric substrates to 
design the Sub-THz AiP. In this paper, two AiP architectures are discussed: In this first architecture, a thicker core is used. 
The thickness of the first AiP with all the layers is 850 µm. This includes ground and metal planes with metal via-pad and 
anti-pad. For the second architecture, a thinner core is used, and it brings down the thickness to 400 µm. In the metal 
layer, a rectangular metal patch radiator is placed. While simulating it is observed that the AiP with the thinner thickness 
produce larger bandwidth of 6.6 GHz at 110 GHz resonant frequency. When the antenna is extended to 2-by-2, 4-by-2,

4-by-4, 4-by-4, 8-by-4, and 8-by-8, it is observed that the bandwidth and gain increased. For 8-by-8, the AiP exhibits a 
19.65 dBi gain and 9.19 GHz bandwidth.
3.2  Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) based slot antenna
This paper [28] also proposes a D-band (110–170 GHz) antenna that aims to provide higher data rates. The antenna is 
chosen to be a wideband PCB based SIW slot antenna designed. To support higher order modes, a wide cavity is selected. 
Figure 13 shows the Proposed antenna with WR6-SIW transition. The antenna architecture comprises of top and bottom 
metal layers, and they are joined to create SIW line and cavity. The two layers communicates with arrays of vias, and their 
dimensions are optimized to ensure that the radiation loss is less than or equal to − 0.06 dB throughout the D-band. The 
top metal layer is etched with a rectangular slot to support the antenna performance. Upon simulation, the antenna 
resonates at six different frequencies in the D-band. The modes supported by this structure are ­TE310 at 114.2 GHz and 
­TE210 at 134.75 GHz. The other four resonance frequencies, identified at 124 GHz, 144 GHz, 154 GHz, and 160 GHz, result 
from hybrid modes. The first two are created by the merging of ­TE310–TE120 and ­TE120–TE220 modes, respectively, while 
the last two originate from the combination of ­TE220–TE320 modes.
3.3  Leaky wave wire antenna
The antenna in [29] is a leaky wave wire antenna which is also another D-band antenna that operates at 120 GHz with a 
simulated gain of 9.9 dBi. Figure 14 shows the Leaky Wave Antenna. The design of the antenna features four metal wires 
wrapped around a Teflon rod, with each wire being twisted at a rate of 520°. This antenna architecture is simple and 
does not require tedious fabrication process. However, this paper does not cover feeding mechanisms for exciting this 
antenna, as designing and selecting optimal feeding mechanisms for these architectures poses significant challenges. 
If properly excited, this architecture can be used for 6G communications.
3.4  Stacked patch 4‑by‑4 antenna array
The antenna in [30] is a stacked patch 4-by-4 antenna array that was built to target data-intensive 6G applications includ-
ing driver-less vehicles, extended reality, and broadband plus. To support 100 GB/s application, the antenna must sup-
port at least of 25 GHz bandwidth. Figure 15 shows the D-band stacked patch antenna design. (a) PCB stack-up (CORE:

design consists of six conductor layers. In these six layers, the ground plane, microstrip feeding network, top and bot-
tom patches can be found. Two ground layers with no connection are placed between the top and bottom patches to 
construct via barriers. Surface waves between each antenna element are suppressed as a result. Upon simulating a single 
antenna element, the structure yielded the 40 GHz bandwidth and 6.9 dBi gain. This structure is extended to 4-by-4 planar 
array and measured to find the resonance is at 140 GHz featuring a 35 GHz bandwidth that spans from 123–158 GHz, 
along with a gain of 17.5 dBi.
3.5  MIMO D‑band antenna array
The antenna described in [31] is another promising candidate for 6G communication. Figure 16 shows the geometry 
of the low profile antenna (a) top view (b) metric view. The antenna consists of 8-by-8 antenna arrays that provides a

gain of 18.3 dB and a bandwidth of 17 GHz from 142-155.5 GHz with 150 GHz being resonant frequency. The design 
process involves first constructing 1-by-8 MIMO patch array and each element of this patch array is cascaded using 
series feed. After constructing 1-by-8 array, an 8-by-8 array is formed with 8 elements of 1-by-8 array. The 8-by-8 
array is connected using a 50 Ω 1-to-8 Wilkinson power divider. By connecting the antenna in this configuration, the 
antenna provided a wider bandwidth which will allow this antenna to transmit signals at higher data rates.
3.6  Symmetrical multi slot THz microstrip antenna
The antenna described in [32] features a silicon substrate with a butterfly-shaped radiation arm that is symmetrical 
from left to right, and it utilizes a lumped port for excitation. Figure 17 shows the Antenna 3 and specific structure 
of “loop” patch. The antenna is constructed in multiple iterations to improve the performance and support 6G com-
munication requirements. In the first iteration, the antenna resembles a traditional bow tie with slots. In addition to 
this, a circular and semi-circular patch was etched at the symmetry and two ends of the radiation arms, respectively. 
The antenna upon simulation reveals that it resonates at 228 GHz and 243 GHz with the 31.4 GHz operating band-
width and 7.44 dB gain. To further improve the performance, in the second iteration, a vertical rectangular slot is 
cut into the center of the structure. This improved the current distribution, operating bandwidth, and gain. In the 
third iteration, a circular groove was added to the left and right of the central symmetry of the antenna. This moved 
the resonant frequency to 217 GHz and 228 GHz with gain of 3.7 dB and 4.5 dB, relatively. The inclusion of a circular 
groove expanded the operating bandwidth to 33 GHz, resulting in a relative bandwidth for the structure of 41.25%.

Perspective
3.7  Circularly polarized Sub‑THz four‑layer antenna
The antenna designed in [33] operates in sub-THz frequency region to combat high atmospheric attenuation, and to 
support high data rates and large bandwidths. However, in sub-THz band, using a relatively thick substrate produces 
surface waves and this in turn will result in narrower bandwidth antennas. To avoid this issue, the antenna is designed 
using brass and it is Circularly Polarized (CP). Figure 18 shows the Exploded view of the antenna.The antenna consists 
of four layers: radiating window, an excitation layer, an air cavity, and a coupling layer. The radiation characteristics is 
like of an Air-filled Channelized Coplanar Waveguide (ACCPW) and a 300 GHz WR-3 waveguide is used to center feed 
the structure. The antenna offers a 12 GHz axial ratio bandwidth from 278.2–290.2 GHz, within an 8.9% impedance 
bandwidth from 270-295 GHz and boasts a gain of 11.9 dBic and 95.1% efficiency. Its compact size of 2.25λ -by- 2.25λ 
-by- 0.5λ at 285 GHz makes it ideal for next generation sub-THz 6G applications.
3.8  Circularly polarized horn antenna
Another CP antenna for 6G applications were discussed in [34], but this is a horn antenna. Figure 19 shows the 3-D 
exploded view of the antenna.This horn antenna is fabricated using the wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) 
method. Designed for operation at 300 GHz, the antenna features a WR-03 rectangular waveguide feed, a circular 
polarizer disk, and a conical horn. The circular polarizer is made up of crossed slots of unequal lengths, which are

perpendicular to each other. Adjusting the lengths of these slots allows for the observation of the Circular Polariza-
tion (CP) radiation pattern. The antenna provides a 20% impedance bandwidth, ranging from 270 GHz to 330 GHz, 
with a reflection coefficient of ≤ − 15 dB. Additionally, it offers a 7 GHz axial ratio bandwidth between 309-316 GHz, 
achieving a minimum axial ratio of 1.15 dB at 312 GHz.
3.9  THz dipole reflector antenna
6G wireless communication is expected to operate in THz to provide higher data rate compared to 5G and other older 
communication standards [4]. One of the promising antenna candidate is proposed in [35]. The antenna is simple dipole 
with reflectors and directors that operates between 295–400 GHz with 33.8% impedance bandwidth. Figure 20 shows 
the Top view of the single element with a reflector .The antenna resonates at 310 GHz and uses indium phosphide and 
benzo-cyclo-butene as substrates. Gold is used to construct dipole, reflector, and half-circle shaped directors. The overall 
gain through simulation is observed to be 7.27 dBi. Although the proposed antenna features a simple design, the selec-
tion of materials for its substrates and conducting layer renders it both costly and specialized.
3.10  6G Turnstile antenna
The study [36] explores a 1 THz graphene-based turnstile or crossed-dipole patch antenna, chosen for graphene’s superior 
properties over copper in conductivity, tensile strength, and current density at THz frequencies, making it ideal for THz 
6G antennas. Graphene also enables Transverse Magnetic Surface Plasmon Polariton (TM SPP) waves. Figure 21 shows 
the Graphene THz Turnstile Antenna. Constructed from two graphene dipoles on an epoxy and silica substrate, electro-
magnetic simulations show the antenna supports circular polarization with a 30% 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth, 0.454 dBi 
gain, and 69.79% efficiency. However, its low gain raises questions about its effectiveness for 6G communication.
4  Future direction
Future trends in 6G antenna designs are focused on meeting the demands of ultra-fast data rates, low-latency commu-
nication, and enhanced energy efficiency [41, 42]. Here are some key trends:

Perspective
4.1  Terahertz (THz) antenna design
Massive bandwidth is available at THz frequencies, which are operated over 100 GHz using 6G antennas [43]. These 
extremely high frequencies will require antenna designs to be capable of handling smaller, high-gain antennas that 
can overcome the propagation issues associated with THz signals. Research is being done on materials like graphene 
and metamaterials to enable a small and effective THz antenna.
4.2  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
RIS is a method used to modify radio waves without the need of sophisticated signal processing algorithms or active 
power amplifiers [44]. Real-time wireless signal reflection and refraction on passive, tunable surfaces will be possible 
thanks to RIS technology. Because RIS-based antenna designs eliminate the need for high-power transmitters, 6G 
networks will use less energy and be more environmentally friendly.
4.3  Beamforming and beam steering enhancements
6G antenna systems will use AI and machine learning to automatically adjust beamforming. As a result, antennas will 
be able to automatically modify beam direction and power levels in response to network conditions, user location, 
and mobility patterns.
In order to reduce interference and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for more dependable communication, 
antenna arrays use beamforming to focus signals into particular places. While digital beamforming uses digital signal 
processing (DSP) to alter amplitude and phase, analog beamforming uses phase shifters to modify the phase of each 
antenna element. Performance and complexity can be balanced by combining the two approaches[45].In millimeter-
wavelength communications, huge antenna arrays are typically installed at the transmitter and/or receiver to pro-
duce massive beamforming gains in order to offset the significant route loss. For millimeter-wave communications, 
EM-lens enabled MIMO can be used to significantly enhance beamforming performance while lowering hardware 
and signal processing expenses [17].
4.4  Miniaturization and integration
Future antennas may incorporate flexible, conformal designs for better integration with devices like smartphones, 
wearables, and even clothing, offering greater flexibility in product design while maintaining high performance.
In summary, 6G antenna designs will focus on ultra-high frequency operation, intelligent beamforming, and integra-
tion with smart surfaces, all while enhancing energy efficiency and supporting next-generation wireless applications.
